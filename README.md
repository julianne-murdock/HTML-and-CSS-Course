# HTML and CSS Course

The Purpose of this course was to teach the basics of HTML and CSS! Which I feel like I have definetly learned these two topics amazingly well!!

## Description

I learned how to create a full website with both HTML and CSS languages by the end of this course! All projects listed in here were made to help me learn the skills i needed in order to create my portfolio website at the very end. My portfoilo website has been moved to its very own repository because it is super special to me!

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

I don't feel there is any prerequisites that are needed in order to view the code in this repository, as this is very simple HTML and CSS.

## Projects
Here is a list of all of the following projects that were completed during this course:

### Basic_HTML_and_CSS Folder

This folder shows all of the basic mini projects I completed in order to help me learn HTML and CSS.

### Moving_UP_HTML_CSS Folder

These show some projects that I learned from the course and some projects that I fiddled with by learning on my own that I want to keep to reference back too for future website building :)

### Project Directory

This is a list of the bigger projects that I completed in order to prepare me with all of the tools I needed to build my own personal website!

You will find a space website, a movie theater website, some other small projects that have basic learning HTML and CSS techniques.

## Authors

I coded all of these projects except some of them in the Moving_Up_HTML_CSS folder. These projects were based on the assignments assigned to me at The Tech Academy!
